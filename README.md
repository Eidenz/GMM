## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üéÆ Multi-Game Support:** Manage mods for different games (currently supports **Genshin Impact** and **Zenless Zone Zero**) with separate configurations and databases. Easily switch between supported games.
*   **üóÇÔ∏è Mod Library & Categorization:** Automatically scans your mods folder and organizes mods by category (Characters, Weapons, UI, etc.) and entity for the selected game.
*   **üñ±Ô∏è Simple Enable/Disable:** Easily toggle mods on or off with a switch. GMM handles the `DISABLED_` prefix renaming for you.
*   **üñ±Ô∏è Drag & Drop Import:** Drag archive files (.zip, .7z, .rar) directly onto the application window to initiate the import process.
*   **üì¶ Enhanced Archive Import (.zip, .7z, .rar):** Import mods directly from archive files. GMM analyzes contents (including INI hints), suggests mod details, allows root folder selection, or extracts all files.
*   **ü§ñ Advanced Mod Info Deduction:** Attempts to deduce mod name, author, and target entity from folder structure, internal filenames, and INI files during scan/import.
*   **‚ú® Presets System:** Save your current mod setup as a preset for the active game and quickly switch between different mod combinations. Mark favorites for quick access via the sidebar.
*   **üìä Enhanced Dashboard:** Get a quick glance at your library stats for the active game, including total mods, enabled/disabled counts, and category breakdowns with visual charts.
*   **üöÄ Quick Launch Integration:** Configure a path to your game executable or a mod launcher for one-click launching. Supports standard launch and **elevated (Admin) launch** on Windows if required.
*   **‚å®Ô∏è Keybind Viewer:** Quickly view keybinds defined within a mod's INI files (specifically looks for `key = ...` lines within `[Key.*]` sections *after* a `; Constants` marker).
*   **üñºÔ∏è Image Previews & Lightbox:** Automatically detects and displays common preview images (`preview.png`, etc.). Allows changing previews via file selection or pasting. Click previews to view them in a larger lightbox overlay.
*   **üñ±Ô∏è Context Menu Actions:** Right-click on mods (in list view) for quick actions like opening the mod folder, adding to presets, editing, or deleting.
*   **üîÑ Built-in Updater:** Stay up-to-date with the latest features and fixes via the integrated updater (powered by Tauri).
*   **ü¶Ä Tauri Powered:** Built with Rust (backend) and React (frontend) via Tauri for a fast and efficient cross-platform experience.

## üöÄ Usage Guide

1.  **Initial Setup:**
    *   On first launch, you'll be prompted to select the game you want to configure first (e.g., Genshin Impact).
    *   You *must* select the main folder where you store your mods for that specific game (e.g., `...\GIMI\Mods`).
    *   Optionally, select the game or launcher executable for Quick Launch for that game.
2.  **Switching Games:** Use the game switcher on the **Dashboard** or in the **Initial Setup** screen. Switching games requires an application restart (GMM will prompt and handle this). Settings and mods are kept separate for each game.
3.  **Scanning:** After setting the mods folder for a game, go to **Settings -> Scan Mods Folder -> Scan Now**. This populates the library for the *currently active* game.
4.  **Importing:**
    *   **Method 1 (Button):** Click the **Import Mod** button in the sidebar. Select a `.zip`, `.7z`, or `.rar` archive.
    *   **Method 2 (Drag & Drop):** Drag and drop a supported archive file directly onto the GMM window.
    *   **Process:** Review the detected archive contents. GMM may suggest a root folder. Select the correct **Mod Root Folder** (containing the INI/mod files) OR check **Extract All Files**. Fill in/correct the Mod Name, Target Entity (for the current game), and other details. Click **Confirm Import**.
5.  **Browsing:** Use the sidebar to navigate the library for the *currently active* game. Click on an entity card (e.g., Raiden Shogun) to view its mods.
6.  **Managing Mods:**
    *   Click the toggle switch on a mod card (Grid view) or list item (List view) to enable or disable it.
    *   Use the pencil icon to edit mod details (name, description, author, tags, preview image, target entity).
    *   Use the trash icon to delete a mod (removes from disk and database).
    *   Use the keyboard icon to view detected keybinds.
    *   Right-click a mod in list view for context menu actions (Open Folder, Add to Preset, Edit, Delete).
    *   Click on mod preview images to view them larger in a lightbox.
7.  **Bulk Actions (List View):**
    *   Check the boxes next to mods in the list view.
    *   Use the "Enable Selected" / "Disable Selected" buttons that appear in the header.
8.  **Presets:**
    *   Presets are specific to the *currently active* game.
    *   Go to the **Presets** page.
    *   Enter a name and click **Create Preset** to save the current mod configuration for this game.
    *   Click the play icon next to a preset to apply it.
    *   Use other icons to overwrite, favorite (appears in sidebar), or delete presets.
9.  **Quick Launch:** Click the **Quick Launch** button in the sidebar. GMM will attempt a standard launch first. If that fails with an elevation error (on Windows), it will prompt for admin permission to launch elevated.
