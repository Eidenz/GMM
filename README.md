## üöÄ Usage Guide

1.  **Initial Setup:** On first launch, you *must* select the main folder where you store your Genshin mods (e.g., `...\GIMI\Mods`). Optionally, select the XXMI launcher executable for Quick Launch.
2.  **Scanning:** After setting the mods folder, go to **Settings -> Scan Mods Folder -> Scan Now**. This will populate the manager with your existing mods. Run this again whenever you manually add or delete mods outside the manager.
3.  **Importing:**
    *   Click the **Import Mod** button in the sidebar.
    *   Select a `.zip`, `.7z`, or `.rar` archive.
    *   **Alternatively:** Drag and drop a supported archive file directly onto the GMM window.
    *   Review the detected archive contents and select the correct **Mod Root Folder** (the folder containing the actual mod files/INI).
    *   Fill in/correct the Mod Name, Target Entity, and other details.
    *   Click **Confirm Import**.
4.  **Browsing:** Use the sidebar to navigate between categories (Characters, Weapons, etc.). Click on an entity card (e.g., Raiden Shogun) to view its mods.
5.  **Managing Mods:**
    *   Click the toggle switch on a mod card (Grid view) or list item (List view) to enable or disable it.
    *   Use the pencil icon to edit mod details (name, description, author, tags, preview image, target entity).
    *   Use the trash icon to delete a mod (removes from disk and database).
    *   Use the keyboard icon to view detected keybinds from the mod's INI files.
6.  **Bulk Actions (List View):**
    *   Check the boxes next to mods in the list view.
    *   Use the "Enable Selected" / "Disable Selected" buttons that appear in the header.
7.  **Presets:**
    *   Go to the **Presets** page.
    *   Enter a name and click **Create Preset** to save your current enabled/disabled mod configuration.
    *   Click the play icon next to a preset to apply it.
    *   Use other icons to overwrite, favorite, or delete presets.
8.  **Quick Launch:** Click the **Quick Launch** button in the sidebar to start the executable configured in Settings.
